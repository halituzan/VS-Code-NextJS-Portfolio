    "description": "After my 5-year E-commerce venture, I decided to improve myself in the software field. While I was developing software for my e-commerce company at this stage, my interest in the software field increased even more. While I was making developments as an amateur, I decided to do this job professionally and started my professional software life with a bootcamp training. After the training I received in 2020, I left the e-commerce industry by switching to software life. Since this date, I have been developing software in the Javascript ecosystem. During this process, I developed my projects using JavaScript frameworks such as ReactJs and NextJs. I used various CSS libraries and UI libraries during these developments. I developed my projects with Bootstrap and SCSS technologies, mainly with Tailwindcss. I made UI enhancements using MaterialUI, Mantin and NextUI libraries. Realizing that state management was becoming more difficult as my projects grew, I learned Redux and Redux-toolkit libraries and used these libraries in my new projects. To overcome the difficulties of teamwork, I improved myself in the use of Eslint and learned Typescript and worked on new type-controlled projects. While I improve myself in these subjects, I also continue to learn NodeJs and develop my projects Full-Stack using MongoDB."
